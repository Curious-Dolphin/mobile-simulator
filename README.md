# mobile-simulator
Mobile robot simulator in gazebo
The package uses ROS 2, it is inspired by Josh Newans of Articulated Robotics.
For now the package only simulates a differential drive robot.
Updates will be made.
To run the package clone the repository and execute the following command in the terminal:
```
colcon build
ros2 launch mobilo gazebo_launch.py
```
